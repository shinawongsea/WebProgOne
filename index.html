			<p>I am a student in the Instructional Technology: Web Design graduate certificate program. I earned my BA in Sociology from USF in 2018.
                Currently, I am an Academic Program Specialist for the USF School of Information. 
				The undergraduate and graduate programs in my department are offered 100% online.
