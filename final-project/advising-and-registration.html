			<h2>Program Overview</h2>
			<br>
			<p>The M.A. in Library and Information Science (MLIS) is designed to prepare students for careers and leadership
			roles in library and information professions that serve the needs of a culturally diverse, technological society.
			 The program is fully online (asynchronous), and offers student a flexible curriculum for them to meet their professional goals.
			 Graduates of USF’s LIS program work in libraries, businesses, and various information agencies across the state, nationally,
			and internationally. Students complete a set of six required core courses as the foundation for the degree and can choose a 
			career path through seven electives in alignment with their professional goals and interests.
			</p><br><br>

			<h3>Accreditation</h3>
			<br>
			<p>The M.A. in Library and Information has been continually accredited by the American Library Association (ALA) since 1974,
				with the most recent review for continued accreditation occurring in 2016.
				Completion of the degree provides the professional credential commonly required for employment in many libraries
				and other information agencies. For those interested in becoming School Library Media Specialists, 
				the degree offers coursework that will prepare students to pass the examination for certification required by the 
				State of Florida.</p><br><br>
			
			<h3>Culminating Assessment</h3>
				<br>
			<p>In lieu of a Comprehensive Examination, students are required to submit a portfolio in accordance with program provided guidelines
			   which exhibit competencies acquired during their program based on standards of the American Library Association. 
			   It is the student’s responsibility to determine
			   and gather appropriate artifacts and write a focused narrative which best represent their synthesis of program outcomes.
			   The artifacts and narrative should be presented in a way which clearly indicates their knowledge and application of program outcomes.
			</p>

			<h2>LIS IRL</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Check out this video from Great Big Story on the world's most magnificent (and bizarre) libraries.
			</p>
			<p>From Great Big Story: <i>In this reel, we circumnavigate the globe in search of some of the most unusual and awe-inspiring libraries
				collecting more than just books. We begin in Alaska at a particularly *macabre* library checking out
				preserved and taxidermied animals, head on over to China to kick back in a surreal, infinite reading room,
				and get whiff of history at the library of smells.</i></p>
